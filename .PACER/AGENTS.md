# AGENTS.md — Operating Inside a PACER Repository

Binding rules. If a rule here conflicts with your inclination, the rule wins. If a rule conflicts with the user's explicit instruction, the user wins — log the exception as a Note on the affected row.

## 0. Session start protocol

1. Read `README.md` (what PACER is), then this file.
2. Query state — do not read files whole. Standard opening queries:
   - Ready work: todo rows with `Status=TODO` and all hard `BlockedBy` DONE.
   - Health map: organism rows by status (`SCAFFOLD` / `PACED_REQUIREMENT` counts).
   - Active growth: nodule rows with `Status=ACTIVE`.
3. Before touching any source file, query overlord for its row(s) by `Path`. If none exists, the file is off-register: create the OVR row as part of your change, or refuse the change and flag it.

## 1. File roles and write rights

| File | You may | You may never |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `todo.PACER.csv` | Add PACs; transition status; append Notes/LearningNotes/PreviousAttempts; set fields per lexicon | Delete rows; weaken a DoD to force a DONE; renumber IDs |
| `overlord.PACER.csv` | Add/update rows for assets you touch, same commit as the code change | Let it drift from source reality; delete rows for deleted code (mark `Tags` `#dead` + Note, prune only at milestone audits) |
| `organism.PACER.csv` | Advance statuses with evidence; add rows via nodule absorption; update refs | Set `VALIDATED_COMPLETE` without `AcceptanceEvidence`; delete requirements |
| `nodule.PACER.csv` | Create when pacing a user request; update status; absorb | Run two ACTIVE nodules in one lane; delete an unabsorbed nodule |

One canonical copy of each register. Atomic writes (write temp, validate, move). Multi-agent mutation goes through the command lexicon with a single applying writer; filtered views are read-only handouts.

## 2. Todo lifecycle (unchanged PACER core)

- Transitions: `TODO→DOING`, `DOING→REVIEW`, `DOING→TODO`, `REVIEW→DONE`, `REVIEW→DOING`. Nothing else.
- `StartedAt` on entering DOING, `DoneAt` on entering DONE (UTC ISO 8601).
- Dependency gate: DONE only if every **hard** `BlockedBy` is DONE. Soft/optional never gate.
- ≤3 rows in DOING per agent. >48h in DOING → split (`PAC-123A/B`) with narrower DoDs; parent blocks on children.
- Every significant change: one-line Note. Every completed task that taught you something: LearningNotes. Every failed approach: PreviousAttempts — the next agent must not repeat you.

## 3. Overlord discipline (the map must match the territory)

- Code change and OVR update are **one commit**. A merged change with a stale overlord is a defect.
- Row granularity: FILE always; MODULE/CLASS/FUNCTION/METHOD rows for anything exported, imported across files, or referenced by an OGM requirement. Internal helpers do not get rows.
- `Requires`/`RequiredBy` are OVR-to-OVR edges and must be symmetric: if OVR-003 Requires OVR-002, OVR-002 lists OVR-003 in RequiredBy. Asymmetry fails validation.
- `Exports`/`Imports` are the literal symbols/paths — this is what lets an agent answer "what breaks if I change this signature" from three greps.

## 4. Organism discipline (design truth with statuses)

- Statuses: `VALIDATED_COMPLETE` | `PACED_REQUIREMENT` | `SCAFFOLD` — exactly one, definitions per README.
- `SCAFFOLD → PACED_REQUIREMENT`: the moment the incompleteness is *because of* an unbuilt reference — record what blocks it (`BlockedByOGM`, `PACRefs`).
- `→ VALIDATED_COMPLETE`: requires `AcceptanceEvidence` (test run, audit, dated verification). No evidence, no status.
- Regression rule: if landed code breaks a VALIDATED_COMPLETE requirement, demote it immediately with a Note naming the offending commit/PAC. The organism never flatters the codebase.
- The organism is also the changelog: status transitions + Notes + `UpdatedAt` ARE the project history. Do not create a separate changelog.

## 5. Nodule protocol (the only door for new scope)

1. **Pace it out.** User request → one nodule row: `Intent`, `TargetOVR` (existing assets touched), `NewAssets` (paths/symbols to create), `OGMTargets` (requirements added or advanced), `AbsorptionCriteria`.
2. **Spawn.** Create the nodule's PACs in the todo (`NDLRefs`/`RelatedWork` link back). Status → `ACTIVE`.
3. **Build** under todo rules; overlord updates ride each commit.
4. **Absorb** when criteria are met: advance the OGM targets, verify every new asset has an OVR row, verify all cross-refs resolve, set `AbsorbedAt`, status → `ABSORBED`, move the file to `archive/` (or delete if the project archives via VCS history). The lane is now clear for the next nodule.

- One ACTIVE nodule per lane. Parallel lanes are allowed only when their `TargetOVR` sets are disjoint.
- Scope discovered mid-build that exceeds the nodule's Intent: new nodule. Never silently grow an active one.

## 6. Referencing rules

- IDs immutable, never reused. Multi-refs semicolon-separated. Tags `#lowercase`, shared vocabulary across all four files — check existing tags before minting a new one.
- Every reference must resolve to a live row. Broken refs are validation failures, fixed before commit.
- When you add any row, wire it both ways: the things it references gain back-references where a back-reference column exists.

## 7. Validation (run before every commit that touches a register)

- CSV parses; required columns present; no duplicate IDs.
- Todo: legal statuses/transitions, dependency refs exist, no cycles, no DONE with open hard blockers.
- Overlord: `Requires`/`RequiredBy` symmetry; paths exist in the repo (or `#dead`-tagged).
- Organism: valid status; VALIDATED_COMPLETE rows have evidence.
- Nodule: ACTIVE nodules have ≥1 spawned PAC; ABSORBED nodules have `AbsorbedAt` and satisfied criteria.
- Cross-file: every `PAC-`/`OVR-`/`OGM-`/`NDL-` reference resolves.

## 8. Refusals (respond with the literal string, then stop)

- `REFUSAL: Blocked by {ids}` — DONE attempted with open hard blockers.
- `REFUSAL: Illegal transition {from}->{to}`.
- `REFUSAL: Unknown ID {id}`.
- `REFUSAL: Circular dependency detected`.
- `REFUSAL: Evidence required` — VALIDATED_COMPLETE without AcceptanceEvidence.
- `REFUSAL: Off-register asset` — source change requested for a path with no OVR row and no permission to create one.
- `REFUSAL: Nodule lane occupied` — second ACTIVE nodule on overlapping TargetOVR.

## 9. Prime directives

1. The registers are the single source of truth. If code and register disagree, stopping to reconcile IS the work.
2. Query, don't read. Load rows, not files. Follow references only as deep as the task requires.
3. Leave the web stronger: every touch adds references, evidence, or learning — never orphans.
4. Everything connects. Everything works together or it dies.
